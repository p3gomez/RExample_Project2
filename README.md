# RExample_Project2
HSP90 is a gene associated with breast cancer; what similarities or differences exist between the 3D homology models of the binding sites of 2 potential drugs (17-DMAG &amp; PU-H71), and how successful are those drugs as treatments via analysis of drug tumor retention by targeting HSP90?

# Explanation of All Files
A few files will be needed to run the code. They are described below:
1) The "1YET & 2FWZ Superimposed.png" file is the image which I created in PyMol. It superimposed both protein structures on top of one another, to not find not only an overlap in the structure of the HSP90 protein, but a similar location/structure for the binding site of both drugs, geldanamycin and PU-H71.
2) The "1YET.png" file is the image which I created in PyMol. It used the PDB structure (1YET), to find the location of the HSP90 protein in light purple, and the location of the drug, geldanamycin in red (NOTE: 17-DMAG is a derivative of geldanamycin).
3) The "2FWZ.png" file is the image which I created in PyMol. It used the PDB structure (2FWZ), to find the location of the HSP90 protein in light orange, and the location of the drug, PU-H71 in green.
4) The "Drug Tumor Retention.csv" file was data taken from a scientific article which included drug tumor retention amounts when breast cancer HSP70 inhibitor drugs were administered. Data from the file was used to conduct a Welch's t-test, obtain a p-value, and thus aid in accepting or rejecting my scientific hypothesis.
5) The "Project 2C_Draft 1 of RNotebook and Self-Assessment_Patricia Marie Gomez_R-mateys 12" file is my draft of Projet 2, in rmd format.
6) The "Project 2C_Draft 1 of RNotebook and Self-Assessment_Patricia Marie Gomez_R-mateys 12.nb.html" file is my draft of Project 2, in html format.

# Scientific Question
HSP90 is a gene associated with breast cancer; what similarities or differences exist between the 3D homology models of the binding sites of 2 potential drugs (17-DMAG & PU-H71), and how successful are those drugs as treatments via analysis of drug tumor retention by targeting HSP90?

# Scientific Hypothesis
If the two HSP90 inhibitor drugs, 17-DMAG and PU-H71, do NOT have significantly different drug tumor retention amounts, then both drugs do NOT have different success rates as breast cancer drug treatments.
